This app compliments my other app titled "GoogleRoadTripMap", you can see it <a href="https://github.com/Artperkitny/GoogleRoadTripMap">here</a>
Using googles maps api reverse geolocation function, I converted logitude and latitude data to human readable addresses. I collect three important pieces of info for each location i stored in my database (Locatlity, Territory, and Country)
